  Understanding viscous effects in bouncing drops\\ (Part II: Numerics)

\section*{Description}
Recently, during one of his trips to the International Space Station, astronaut Scott Kelly demonstrated that one could play ping-pong in space using water drops (\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLbhrMCM4_0}{link here}). This demonstration follows from a long history of research on bouncing drops on superhydrophobic surfaces (see the discussions related to bouncing off superhydrophobic surfaces in \citet{josserand2016drop}).\\
In this study, we would like to understand this process of bouncing droplets. Figure~\ref{Figure::Typical} shows a typical sequence of a drop bouncing off a dry substrate. A similar process occurs if a thin film of a different more viscous oil is present on the (wet) substrate. In our simulation, we will use an in-house developed read-to-use code to solve the problem of the liquid drop impact on both dry and wet substrates.\\
We will focus on the hydrodynamics of the process. In particular, we wish to understand various mechanisms through which the initial kinetic energy of the drop is dissipated in the system. Drawing analogy with the impact of rigid balls, we will also calculate the coefficient of restitution as a function of the viscosities of drop and thin liquid film.

\section*{What you will do and what you will learn?}
In the Physics of Fluids group, we are looking for enthusiastic students to work on this topic.
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em
\item You will learn about fundamental fluid dynamics.
\item You will get hands-on experience with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
\item You will learn how to do basic and advance data analysis.
\item You will work closely with experimentalists in trying to undertand the physical process, and for validation of the numerical code.
\end{enumerate}
