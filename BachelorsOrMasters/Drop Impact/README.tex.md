  Playing ping-pong with liquid droplets

\section*{Description}
Recently, during one of his trips to the International Space Station, astronaut Scott Kelly demonstrated that one could play ping-pong in space using water drops (\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLbhrMCM4_0}{link here}). This demonstration follows from a long history of research on bouncing drops on superhydrophobic surfaces (see the discussions related to bouncing off superhydrophobic surfaces in \citet{josserand2016drop, VatsalThesis}).\\

In this study, we would like to further our understanding of this process of bouncing droplets \citep{zhang2022impact, vatsalInProgress, sanjay2022drop}. A typical sequence of events is shown in Figure~\ref{Figure::Typical}. In our simulation, we will use an in-house developed read-to-use code to solve the problem of the liquid drop impact on dry substrate. We will focus on the hydrodynamics of the process.

 \caption{A typical simulation of a drop bouncing off a superhydrophobic substrate: (a) The drop approaches the substrate, (b) Air is squeezed out of the thin gap between the drop and the substrate, leading to lubrication flow in the gap, (c) The drop spreads on the substrate (see \citet{wildeman2016spreading}), (d) - (e) The drop changes the direction of motion because of the substrate, and (f) The drop bounces back.}

\section*{What you will do and what you will learn?}
In the Physics of Fluids group, we are looking for enthusiastic students to work on this topic.
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em
\item You will learn about fundamental fluid dynamics.
\item You will get hands-on experience with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
\item You will learn how to do basic and advance data analysis.
\item You will learn how to document and publish ready to use codes and share it with the community, similar to \citet{basiliskVatsal, basiliskVatsalDropFilm, basiliskVatsalViscousBouncing}. 
\end{enumerate}

As a part of your bachelor's/master's assignment, we would like you to explore the field and come up with exciting avenues. To get you started, here is a list of open questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How does the normal contact force between the drop and the substrate vary with the drop's viscosity and velocity?
	\item Drop impact dynamics (including normal contact force and coefficient of restitution) in the limit of zero impact velocity. 
	\item Dissipate anomaly in the limit of zero drop viscosity. 
	\item Hydrodynamic singularities in drop impact and how are they regularized? See: \citet{mandre2012mechanism} for impact time singularity and \citet{Bartolo2006Singular, sanjay_lohse_jalaal_2021, zhang2022impact} for singular jets. 
\end{enumerate}
