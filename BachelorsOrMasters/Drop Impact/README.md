Playing ping-pong with liquid droplets

# Description {#description .unnumbered}

Recently, during one of his trips to the International Space Station,
astronaut Scott Kelly demonstrated that one could play ping-pong in
space using water drops ([link
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLbhrMCM4_0)). This demonstration
follows from a long history of research on bouncing drops on
superhydrophobic surfaces (see the discussions related to bouncing off
superhydrophobic surfaces in @josserand2016drop [@VatsalThesis]).\
In this study, we would like to further our understanding of this
process of bouncing droplets
[@zhang2022impact; @vatsalInProgress; @sanjay2022drop]. A typical
sequence of events is shown in
FigureÂ [1](#Figure::Typical){reference-type="ref"
reference="Figure::Typical"}. In our simulation, we will use an in-house
developed read-to-use code to solve the problem of the liquid drop
impact on dry substrate. We will focus on the hydrodynamics of the
process.

![A typical simulation of a drop bouncing off a superhydrophobic
substrate: (a) The drop approaches the substrate, (b) Air is squeezed
out of the thin gap between the drop and the substrate, leading to
lubrication flow in the gap, (c) The drop spreads on the substrate (see
@wildeman2016spreading), (d) - (e) The drop changes the direction of
motion because of the substrate, and (f) The drop bounces
back.](Figure1.pdf){#Figure::Typical width="\\textwidth"}

# What you will do and what you will learn? {#what-you-will-do-and-what-you-will-learn .unnumbered}

In the Physics of Fluids group, we are looking for enthusiastic students
to work on this topic.

1.  You will learn about fundamental fluid dynamics.

2.  You will get hands-on experience with Computational Fluid Dynamics
    (CFD).

3.  You will learn how to do basic and advance data analysis.

4.  You will learn how to document and publish ready to use codes and
    share it with the community, similar to @basiliskVatsal
    [@basiliskVatsalDropFilm; @basiliskVatsalViscousBouncing].

As a part of your bachelor's/master's assignment, we would like you to
explore the field and come up with exciting avenues. To get you started,
here is a list of open questions:

1.  How does the normal contact force between the drop and the substrate
    vary with the drop's viscosity and velocity?

2.  Drop impact dynamics (including normal contact force and coefficient
    of restitution) in the limit of zero impact velocity.

3.  Dissipate anomaly in the limit of zero drop viscosity.

4.  Hydrodynamic singularities in drop impact and how are they
    regularized? See: @mandre2012mechanism for impact time singularity
    and @Bartolo2006Singular
    [@sanjay_lohse_jalaal_2021; @zhang2022impact] for singular jets.
